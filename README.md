# Oracle-SQL
A introduction to SQL using Oracle

## Description
This is a summary from a course I learnt in Udemy, it is [Oracle SQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-oracle-sql/).
It is a complete guide to whom is new with SQL and Database as well. This course covers wide range of functions in SQL, especially
with Oracle. In my opinion, this course is perfectly suitable with whom started learn Database but just understands concepts without
practical skills.

## Software 
In this course, I was guided to use [Oracle 18c](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe18c-downloads.html) and [Oracle SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/). Choose software that matchs with your OS.

Probably, you will get stuck with installing. It's okay, because I did, and I had spent around 2 hours fixing them. In my case, I had installed Oracle XE 19c before but I forgot my SYSTEM password so it took me far to delete it completely after reinstall all software. Thus, be careful with your SYS password.

One more thing, for using this repo effectively, get the sample data.

## Disclaimer
I don't recommend you to clone this repository and run each files, because the queries I wroten just for example and illustrate how to write a sample queries. I hope you can try it yourself by writing queries for your own database. Thanks!
